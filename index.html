<h1>Jaime Meyer Beilis Michel</h1>
<p>Welcome! You have reached my home on the internet.</p>
<p>I am a mathematician and computer scientist from Mexico, studying at the University Of Arizona</p>
<p>In terms of math research, I am interested in cryptography, abstract algebra, number theory, design of experiments and topology </p>
<p>I am pursuing a doctorate degree in mathematics. </p>

<p>In terms of computer science, I am interested in computer organization, optimization of algorithms, grammar-automata, graphics programming, and machine learning.<p>

    Projects
</h3>

<list>
<li>
    Parallel tempering algorithm optimzation
</li>
<span style="font-style: italic; color: gray;">
    Creation of a parallel tempering algorithm for space-filling designs, exploration and hyperparameter tuning of the algorithm's temperature schedule and number of chains.
</span>
<li>Touchdesigner particle systems</li>
<span style="font-style: italic; color: gray;">
    Development of physics-based interactive particle systems. And bezier-curve modeling utilizing parameterization of particles.
    Collaborated in a VR experience piping touchdesigner as a background to Unity, effectively reducing the Unity background load to one quad; permitting background rendering in touchdesigner.
</span>
<li>Cryptography</li>
<span style="font-style: italic; color: gray;">
    Implementation of cryptographic algorithms. I am fond of exploring the number theory foundation that underlies cryptography; as well as encryption-decryption algorithm optimization through computer organization and probability based heuristics.

<h3>
    About me
</h3>

<p>
    I love music and spend most of my time indulging in it, I play the guitar, and am specially fond of rhythmically complex music, like math rock and jazz fusion. Some other hobbies include occassionally taking long walks and finding new ways to get to the same destinations I visit daily, editing wikipedia, and reading Iberoamerican literature. 
</p>
<p>
    Oftentimes I can be found playing tetris, playing chess games, or speedrunning sudokus.
